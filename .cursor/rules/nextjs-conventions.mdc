# Adding content inside web projects using Next.js

## Key Principles

- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)


## Conventions

- Limit 'use client':
- Never make a `page.tsx` have a client directive ("use client").
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Favor server-side rendering and RSCs.
- "use client" should only be used in small components that are in either `shared/components` or `features/[feature]/components`
- Avoid state management as much as possible, rely on browser state (URL querys, database)
- Use `nuqs` package for URL search parameter state management.
